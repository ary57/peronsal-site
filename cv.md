### **Opening**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm applying for the Software Developer II position at Iowa State University. I'm currently a full-stack developer at Cigna Group, and I'm looking to relocate to Iowa to be closer to family. As a University of Iowa graduate and former employee, I'm familiar with the unique challenges and rewards of working in higher education technology, and I'd love to bring that experience to ISU.

### **What I Bring**

I bring a collaborative approach to development—I enjoy working with people to understand their needs and building solutions that genuinely make their jobs easier. At Cigna, I've been the sole frontend developer building an internal compliance monitoring platform using React, TypeScript, and Flask. I've worked across the full stack—from UI components to RESTful APIs to database integration—but what's made this role particularly rewarding is the freedom I've had to shape the application from the ground up. Without set requirements from the start, I've worked directly with internal stakeholders to understand their needs and translate those conversations into features that actually solve their problems.---

### **Why This Role**

This role aligns well with my experience and what I enjoy about development. The position calls for someone who can work across the stack and collaborate with diverse users—which is what I've been doing at Cigna and what I find most engaging about my work. Building full-stack applications, working with stakeholders, creating tools that make people's jobs easier—that's the work I want to keep doing. Combined with the opportunity to move back to Iowa, this position feels like the right next step.

### **Closing**

I've attached my resume and would be happy to discuss how my experience fits what you're looking for. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,  
Abhishek Aryal
